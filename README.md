This is a django project with bits of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This project is made with medical labs in mind. You search for your report with Report Id and as an output you get Report in PDF format. 

To run this project you need to install python and django on your machine. (please google it).<br>
If you already have it installed, clone this project and go into the directory where the project resides in bash.<br>
Use the command "python manage.py migrate" without quotes.<br>
Use the command "python manage.py makemigrations" without quotes.<br>
To run the server use "python manage.py runserver" without quotes and if no error shows go to the url "localhost" in your browser. and it should load up. <br>
Cheers. Suggestions and contributions are Welcomed.
